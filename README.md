# elfin-solver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joy13975/elfin-solver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joy13975/elfin-solver)

The `master` branch is currently under development and is not currently functional. The old v1 version code and documentation can be found in branch `v1`.

Since [elfin-ui](https://github.com/joy13975/elfin-ui) are still undergoing active development, the internal data representation and the problem scope are still evolving. That forced me to put a brake on 
working on elfin-solver.
